# Blog code

The source code of my Jekyll blog, being hosted on [neocities](martinoshelf.neocities.org).

It's majorly based on [Moonwalk](https://abhinavs.github.io/moonwalk/), with some edits and stiff to remove parts I didn0t care about.

I also added server side rendering for math via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), thanks to [this blogpost](https://gendignoux.com/blog/2020/05/23/katex.html)
